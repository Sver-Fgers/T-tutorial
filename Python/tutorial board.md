## What we know

- [ ] Introduction to Computers and Programming
	- Hardware and Software 
	- How Computers Store Data
	- How a Program Works
		- what is a code
		- what is coding & programming
- [ ] setting up Python for programming
	- Setting up Jupiter notebooks
- [ ] Python features
	- python is case sensitive
	- python is mostly object oriented (OOP) but allows for flexibility with other programming methods
	- python is a general purpose program
- [ ] - Designing a program
		- The program development life cycle
	- A basic program does this
		- collect **input** 
		- **processes** the input
