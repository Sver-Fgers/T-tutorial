1. Practice Question 1: Reverse Codon Mapping and Grouping
a) You're given a file called codon_to_amino.txt. Each line contains 3 DNA bases and the amino acid they code for. Some amino acids may have multiple codons.
b) Read the file and create a dictionary where:
	The key is the amino acid.
	The value is a list of all codons (as strings, e.g., 'GTT') that produce that amino acid.
c) Print the dictionary in alphabetical order of the amino acid.
d) Convert it into a pandas DataFrame with columns:
	AminoAcid
	Codons (a string showing codons separated by commas)

2. Practice Question 2: Translate Nucleotide Sequence to Protein
You are given a DNA nucleotide sequence in a file called nucleotide_sequence.txt. Your task is to:

a) Read the sequence from the file (all in one line, no spaces).
b) Split it into codons (groups of 3 letters).
c) Use a codon dictionary (same as from codon_to_amino.txt) to translate it into a protein sequence of amino acids.
d) Stop the translation if a stop codon (*) is encountered.
e) Create a final amino acid sequence string (e.g., "MVK"), and print the result.

Tip:
- Read nucleotide_sequence.txt and loop through the sequence 3 letters at a time.
- Use the dictionary to find the amino acid.
- Stop when you see * (e.g., "TAA" â†’ *).
